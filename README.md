## RTL Design Workshop – 5 Day Overview

The workshop presented a full course in RTL (Register Transfer Level) design and synthesis in Verilog HDL and free tools like Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, and Yosys. The day was organized with an equal mix of concepts and lab sessions so that participants could build up their knowledge and hands-on skills in digital design gradually.

## Day 1 – Introduction to Verilog and Simulation

Introduction to Verilog HDL basics and digital design.
Development of basic modules and testbenches.

Simulation with Icarus Verilog and waveform visualization using GTKWave.

Initial lab experiments with simple combinational circuits.

## Day 2 – Combinational Logic and Synthesis Fundamentals

More in-depth study of combinational logic modeling.

Structural, dataflow, and behavioral design styles.

Yosys synthesis flow introduction and netlisting.
Labs introduced multiplexers and other logic blocks, with comparison between simulation and synthesis results.

## Day 3 – Sequential Logic and Flip-Flops

Learning sequential circuits and storage elements.

In-depth study of flip-flops (D, JK, T) and their behavioral models.

Testing code to watch state changes and timing behavior.

Labs showed synthesis and waveform checking of sequential blocks.

## Day 4 – Finite State Machines (FSMs)

FSM concept and application in digital systems.

Mealy vs. Moore machines difference.

Synthesizing FSMs in Verilog using state transition logic.

Labs involved the implementation of a sequence detector and verification using GTKWave.

## Day 5 – Synthesis Optimization

Coding efficient RTL with if-else, case statements, loops, and generate blocks.

Avoiding unwanted latch inference through identification.

Utilization of for-loops and generate constructs for scalable design.

Lab highlight: implementation of a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) employing generate blocks.

## Overall Learning Outcomes

At the end of the 5-day workshop, the participants could:

Understand the basics of RTL design with Verilog HDL.

Simulate designs and waveform analyze with GTKWave.

Synthesize logic with Yosys and read netlist outputs.

Model combinational and sequential circuits.

Design and verify finite state machines.

Implement coding best practices to write clean, optimized, and synthesizable RTL.
